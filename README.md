## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
### Introduction
This project is an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

### Getting Started
To run this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser.

### Data Source
The data for this project is provided in a JSON file that can be accessed at `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.`

### Visualizations
This dashboard includes two visualizations:

* A horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in an individual sample, based on the sample_values data.
* A bubble chart that displays all the OTUs in a sample, with the size of each bubble corresponding to the sample_values data and the color representing the otu_ids.
### Interactive Features
The dashboard includes a dropdown menu that allows users to select a specific individual sample and update both visualizations with data for that sample. The dashboard also displays the demographic information for the selected individual.

### Deployment
The application is deployed on GitHub Pages at https://sonila15.github.io/belly-button-challenge/. The source code is available in the repository at https://github.com/sonila15/belly-button-challenge.
